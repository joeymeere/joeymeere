Positioner takes your resume and matches you with the best jobs from all over 15 job boards. We do this by extracting keywords from a resume, and using AI to filter it down to the best results for you. We offer a free plan, and two different paid plans depending on how often you'd like job postings, how many boards you'd like data from, and the amount of extra keywords you'd like to add.

###  :fries: CUFries

<img align="center" src="https://i.imgur.com/KfhgqGI.png" width="150">

CUFries is a Clemson dining hall menu aggregator built for the CUHackIt 2023 competiton. The project was built over a 24 hour period in the Watt Center, and consisted of a team of three. 

We created the user interface in Next.js, and self hosted the production build with a Raspberry PI (courtesy of my awesome teammate David!). To pull accurate menu data for the Clemson dining halls, we had to reverse engineer the API of the current menu interface. Using this data, we were able to parse the data, sort between different dining halls, and filter irrelevant data. The end result was a simple but inuitive interface that gives the user the ability to select their food preferences and be given the time and location they're being served.

The project is open-sourced with the MIT license and maintained by my teammates @TheWeirdSquid @k2on and myself.
