## &nbsp; **🧱 2023 Major Projects**

### 🔷 Stockpile

<img align="center" src="https://i.imgur.com/n0lyLaY.jpg" width="500">

Stockpile is community funding suite for projects and businesses that want to avoid loans, but aren't a great fit for angel funding and venture capital.

For projects and businesses looking to get funded without seeking loans or institutional capital, we offer the ability to create crowdfunds based on rewards or future equity agreements. For organizations looking to distribute grants, we provide a system which democratizes the process of distribution across a variety of stakeholders. Existing fundraisers can enter limited time grant rounds, and use contributions as votes for a share of the total grant pool.

###  🍟 CUFries

<img align="center" src="https://i.imgur.com/hBnPna0.png" width="500">

CUFries is a Clemson dining hall menu aggregator built for the CUHackIt 2023 competiton. The project was built over a 24 hour period in the Watt Center, and consisted of a team of three. 

We created the user interface in Next.js, and self hosted the production build with a Raspberry PI (courtesy of my awesome teammate David!). To pull accurate menu data for the Clemson dining halls, we had to reverse engineer the API of the current menu interface. Using this data, we were able to parse the data, sort between different dining halls, and filter irrelevant data. The end result was a simple but inuitive interface that gives the user the ability to select their food preferences and be given the time and location they're being served.

The project is open-sourced with the MIT license and maintained by my teammates @TheWeirdSquid @k2on and myself.
